# Puerto Rican MS Gene Regulatory Architecture
This is a repository meant to store all of my work as a part of the Bush Lab at CWRU. I've stored scripts I've used for data processing in the Aneris-Dev cluster, R scripts for data visualization and analysis. I'm also using this to store presentations of my work on this project.
